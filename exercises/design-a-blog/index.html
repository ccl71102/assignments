    <h2>Lancia Delta Integrale</h2>
    <p class="date-published">Published on June 4, 2019</p>

    <p class="blog-text">
            The Lancia Delta is a small family car produced by 
            Italian automobile manufacturer Lancia in three 
            generations. The first generation produced between 
            1979 and 1994, the second generation from 1993 to 1999, 
            and the third generation from 2008 to 2014.
            The Delta was first shown at the Frankfurt Motor 
            Show in 1979. The Delta dominated the World Rally 
            Championship during the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
            The homologation requirements of Group A regulations 
            meant marketing road-going versions of these competition 
            cars — the Lancia Delta HF 4WD and HF Integrale. A total 
            of 44,296 Integrales were produced.

            The 16v Integrale was developed for rallying, introduced 
            at the 1989 Geneva Motor Show, and made a winning debut 
            on the 1989 San Remo Rally. It featured a raised centre 
            of the bonnet to accommodate the new 16 valve engine, 
            as well as wider wheels and tyres and new identity badges 
            front and rear. The torque split was changed to 47% front 
            and 53% rear. The turbocharged 2-litre Lancia 16v 
            engine produced 200 bhp (149 kW) at 5,500 rpm, for a 
            maximum speed of 137 mph (220 km/h) and 0–100 km/h 
            (0-62 mph) in 5.7 seconds. Changes included larger 
            injectors, a more responsive Garrett T3 turbocharger, 
            a more efficient intercooler, and the ability to run 
            on unleaded fuel without modification.

    <h2>Lancia Delta S4</h2>

    <p class="blog-text">
            The Lancia Delta S4 is a Group B rally car manufactured 
            by the Italian car company Lancia. The Delta S4 competed 
            in the World Rally Championship in 1985 and 1986, until 
            Group B class was disbanded and the cars were eventually 
            banned from competition completely by European sanctioning 
            body FIA. The car replaced, and was an evolution of the 037. 
            The S4 took full advantage of the Group B regulations, and 
            featured a midship-mounted engine and all-wheel drive for 
            superior traction on loose surfaces.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-text">
            The car's 1,759 cc (1.8 L) Inline-four engine combined 
            supercharging and turbocharging to reduce turbo lag at 
            low engine speeds (rpm). The engine generated a maximum 
            output of 490 PS (360 kW; 483 hp) but some sources even 
            claim that the engine was capable of generating 507 PS 
            (373 kW; 500 hp). In 1985, Lancia engineers tested an S4 
            engine under extreme conditions, the engine developed 
            around 1,014 PS (746 kW; 1,000 hp) at 5 bars of boost 
            pressure. An engine capacity multiple of 1.4 was applied 
            to forced induction engines by the FIA and the choice of 
            1,759 cc (1.8 L) put the S4 in the under 2,500 cc class, 
            which allowed for a minimum weight of 890 kg (1,962 lb). 
            The combined super/turbocharger system (often referred to
             as twincharging) was a development of the 037 engine that 
             generated 325 hp (242 kW) with a supercharger only.

    <h2>Lancia 037</h2>

    <p class="blog-text">
            The Lancia Rally (Tipo 151, also known as the Lancia Rally 
            037, Lancia 037 or Lancia-Abarth #037 from its Abarth project 
            code SE037) was a mid-engine sports car and rally car built 
            by Lancia in the early 1980s to compete in the FIA Group B 
            World Rally Championship. Driven by Markku Alén, Attilio 
            Bettega, and Walter Röhrl, the car won Lancia the 
            manufacturers' world championship in the 1983 season. 
            It was the last rear-wheel drive car to win the WRC.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-text">
            The Lancia 037 was a silhouette racer; while it was 
            loosely based on the Lancia Montecarlo (also known as 
            Scorpion in the US and Canadian markets) road car, 
            they shared only the center section with all body 
            panels and mechanical parts being significantly different. 
            Steel subframes were used fore and aft of the 037's center 
            section, while most of the body panels were made from Kevlar. 
            The mid-engined layout of the Montecarlo was retained, 
            but the engine was turned 90 degrees from a transverse 
            position to a longitudinal position. This allowed greater 
            freedom in the design of the suspension while moving engine 
            weight forward. 
    </p>
    <p class="blog-text">
            An independent double wishbone suspension 
            was used on both the front and rear axles, with dual shock 
            absorbers in the rear in order to cope with the stresses of 
            high speed off road driving. The 037 is notable in Group B 
            as it retained the rear-wheel drive layout that was nearly 
            universal for rally cars of the pre-Group B period; nearly 
            all subsequent successful rally cars used four-wheel drive, 
            making the 037 the last of its kind.

    <h2>Lancia Stratos</h2>

    <p class="blog-text">
        The Lancia Stratos HF (Tipo 829), widely and more simply known 
        as Lancia Stratos, is a sports car and rally car made by 
        Italian car manufacturer Lancia. The HF stands for High 
        Fidelity. It was a very successful rally car, winning the 
        World Rally Championship in 1974, 1975 and 1976.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-text">
        The car won the 1974, 1975 and 1976 championship titles in 
        the hands of Sandro Munari and Björn Waldegård, and might 
        have gone on to win more had not internal politics within 
        the Fiat group placed rallying responsibility on the Fiat 
        131 Abarths. As well as victories on the 1975, 1976 and 
        1977 Monte Carlo Rally, all courtesy of Munari, the Stratos 
        won the event with the private Chardonnet Team as late as 
        1979.

    <h2>Lancia Fulvia</h2>

    <p class="blog-text">
        The Lancia Fulvia (Tipo 818) is an automobile 
        produced by Lancia between 1963 and 1976. Named after Via Fulvia, 
        the Roman road leading from Tortona to Torino, it was introduced 
        at the Geneva Motor Show in 1963 and manufactured in three 
        variants: Berlina 4-door saloon, 2-door Coupé, and Sport, 
        an alternative fastback coupé designed and built by Zagato on 
        the Coupé floorpan. Fulvias are notable for their role in 
        motorsport history, including winning the International 
        Rally Championship in 1972. On testing a Fulvia in 1967, 
        Road & Track summed it up as "a precision motorcar, 
        an engineering tour de force".
